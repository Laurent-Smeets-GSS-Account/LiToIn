    "text": "Analysis of Indonesian household data reveals a significant correlation between rising food prices (Inflation) and increased FIES indicators, both within and between regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization above illustrates how local cost of living affects food insecurity, controlling for household income. The y-axis shows the percentage increase in risk of experiencing each food insecurity outcome associated with a one-unit increase in the local cost of living index.\nThe statistical model takes the form:\n\\[\\text{logit}(P(\\text{food\\_insecurity\\_measure} = 1)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{pdef3} + \\varepsilon\\]\nWhere:\n\nfood_insecurity_measure is a binary indicator (0/1) for each food insecurity outcome\nln_pc_def_inc is the log of per capita deflated income (controlling for household resources)\npdef3 is the local cost of living index derived from Susenas data\nStandard errors are clustered at the household level\n\nThe y-axis values represent the percentage increase in the probability of experiencing food insecurity, calculated as:\n\\[\\text{Percentage Increase} = (\\exp(\\beta_2) - 1) \\times 100\\%\\]\nFor example, a value of 350% for “Whole day without food” means that a one-unit increase in the local cost of living index is associated with a 3.5 times higher probability of going a whole day without food, after controlling for income. In other words, households in areas with higher costs of living are substantially more likely to experience severe food insecurity, even when comparing households with similar income levels.\n\n\nTo test this relationship a conditional logistic regression model is used, implemented through the survival::clogit function, which incorporates fixed effects by stratifying observations within groups. This approach is complemented by a linear fixed effects regression model using fixest::feols, allowing for comparison between binary and continuous outcome specifications while controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity.\n\n\n\nLinear modelLogit model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Household Fixed Effects Linear Models\n  \n    \n      Household Fixed Effects Linear Models\n    \n    \n    \n       \n      \n        Food Insecurity Outcomes\n      \n    \n    \n      Worried\n      Unhealthy\n      Low Diversity\n      Skip Meal\n      Eat Less\n      Ran Out\n      Went Hungry\n      Whole Day\n      Totfoodinsec\n    \n  \n  \n    Consumer Price Index\n0.049*** (0.006)\n0.042*** (0.006)\n0.050*** (0.007)\n0.013*** (0.005)\n0.037*** (0.006)\n0.039*** (0.005)\n0.019*** (0.004)\n0.006** (0.003)\n0.255*** (0.026)\n    Num.Obs.\n15496\n15493\n15492\n15489\n15489\n15487\n15486\n15486\n15573\n  \n  \n    \n      * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01\n    \n    \n      Standard errors clustered at household level\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Food Insecurity: Household Fixed Effects Logistic Models\n\n\nFood Insecurity Measure\nOdds Ratio (95% CI)\nStd.

The analysis examines eight distinct food insecurity indicators—from worrying about food to going whole days without eating—and explores how these experiences vary across income quintiles and local food cost distributions. By regressing each food insecurity measure against per capita income, local food prices, and agricultural household status, we can identify which economic factors most strongly predict different manifestations of food insecurity in Indonesia.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Model 1: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 2: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\beta_j \\mathbb{1}(\\text{loc\\_cost\\_quint}_i = j+1) + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 3: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 4: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hhag}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_3 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i\\\\\n\\text{Model 5a: } & \\log\\left(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=1)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 5b: } & \\log(E(y_i)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\\text{where } y_i \\text{ represents household-level FIES (Food Insecurity Experience Scale) outcomes}\\] \\[\\text{Model 5a is used for binary outcomes and Model 5b for count data (when totfoodinsec &gt;

    "text": "These regression models show the relationship between income and the different FIES components, revealing how economic factors such as household income, local food costs, and agricultural participation influence various dimensions of food insecurity. The analysis examines eight distinct food insecurity indicators—from worrying about food to going whole days without eating—and explores how these experiences vary across income quintiles and local food cost distributions. By regressing each food insecurity measure against per capita income, local food prices, and agricultural household status, we can identify which economic factors most strongly predict different manifestations of food insecurity in Indonesia.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Model 1: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 2: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\beta_j \\mathbb{1}(\\text{loc\\_cost\\_quint}_i = j+1) + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 3: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 4: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hhag}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_3 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i\\\\\n\\text{Model 5a: } & \\log\\left(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=1)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 5b: } & \\log(E(y_i)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\\text{where } y_i \\text{ represents household-level FIES (Food Insecurity Experience Scale) outcomes}\\] \\[\\text{Model 5a is used for binary outcomes and Model 5b for count data (when totfoodinsec &gt;

    "text": "The middle class pays attention to government, and their views are responsive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization above illustrates how various factors influence whether middle class Indonesians believe the country is on the right track. The y-axis shows the percentage increase or decrease in probability of a middle class person thinking Indonesia’s policy is on the right track associated with each factor.\nThe statistical model takes the form:\n\\[\\text{logit}(P(\\text{right\\_track} = 1)) = \\beta_{\\text{predictor}} \\cdot \\text{predictor} + \\alpha_i + \\varepsilon\\]\nWhere:\n\nright_track is a binary indicator (0/1) for whether a respondent thinks Indonesia is on the right track\npredictor is each binary indicator for various conditions or beliefs\n\\(\\alpha_i\\) represents household fixed effects\nModels are estimated using conditional logistic regression\n\nThe y-axis values represent the percentage increase in the probability associated with each factor, calculated as:\n\\[\\text{Percentage Increase} = (\\exp(\\beta_{\\text{predictor}}) - 1) \\times 100\\%\\]\nFor example, a value of 241% for “Government is doing well on corruption” means that middle class individuals who believe the government is performing well on anti-corruption efforts are 241% more likely to think the country is on the right track. Conversely, negative values indicate factors that decrease this probability.\nThis analysis reveals that perceptions of government performance on issues like corruption, fair elections, economic performance, and digital services are strongly associated with overall satisfaction with the country’s direction. Interestingly, factors like air pollution concerns and personal economic conditions also play significant roles in shaping middle class views on national progress."
