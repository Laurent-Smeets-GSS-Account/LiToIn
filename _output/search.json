    "text": "These regression models show the relationship between income and the different FIES components, revealing how economic factors such as household income, local food costs, and agricultural participation influence various dimensions of food insecurity. The analysis examines eight distinct food insecurity indicators—from worrying about food to going whole days without eating—and explores how these experiences vary across income quintiles and local food cost distributions. By regressing each food insecurity measure against per capita income, local food prices, and agricultural household status, we can identify which economic factors most strongly predict different manifestations of food insecurity in Indonesia.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Model 1: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 2: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\beta_j \\mathbb{1}(\\text{loc\\_cost\\_quint}_i = j+1) + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 3: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 4: } & y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hhag}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_3 \\text{pdef3}_i + \\varepsilon_i\\\\\n\\text{Model 5a: } & \\log\\left(\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=1)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i \\\\\n\\text{Model 5b: } & \\log(E(y_i)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{ln\\_pc\\_def\\_inc}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{pdef3}_i\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\\text{where } y_i \\text{ represents household-level FIES (Food Insecurity Experience Scale) outcomes}\\] \\[\\text{Model 5a is used for binary outcomes and Model 5b for count data (when totfoodinsec &gt;
